We're compiling insights on what life was like working internally at the company.  Specifically, we'd love to hear from people working on the Trust & Security team, who might be able to speak on the topic of "political" content moderation policies, and policies relating to antisemitism and content around the topic of the Israel and Palestine conflict.  Please note that we would welcome anonymous form submissions - but if you are open to being contacted with follow-up questions, we allow the option for you to share your email address with us.</p>  <p>   <br>Fields on the form: Name Email Are you happy for us to contact you with follow up questions or to arrange an interview (off the record, if required)? Are you currently employed by Reddit? What was your most recent/relevant role at Reddit? Were you involved or aware of internal policies regarding content relating to the Israel and Palestine conflict, or to antisemitism policies? If answering Yes to the previous question - what can you share about any such internal policies? What are your thoughts as to whether Reddit is working to suppress content relating to Gaza and Palestine, or is pro-Israel?

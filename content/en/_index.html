    <p>  <br>Israel is carrying out a genocide on the people of Palestine and this has been taking place for nearly 2 years already. If you use Reddit.com you might be surprised to hear this as there appears to be a coordinated effort to prevent any coverage of this genocide. Yes - there are mentions within specific, smaller subreddits, but careful attention is being given to ensure these threads remain within those subreddits, almost quarantined and restricted from reaching the front page where it would be seen by millions. We believe pro-Israel groups are carefully monitoring content on Reddit to ensure nothing ever reaches the front page - and thus shielding the majority of Reddit's users from the horrendous truth of what is taking place right now in Gaza.</p>  <p>   <br>If you have experienced Reddit content suppression when trying to raise the flag about Israel's ongoing genocide of innocent Palestinians - then please submit your experience through the below form.

    We believe Reddit is censoring the genocide in Gaza - this is our report

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Israel is carrying out a genocide on the people of Palestine and this has been taking place for 2 years already. And for those people who use Reddit (one of the most visited sites on the web) - you should ask yourself - why do you never see Gaza or Palestine related content on the frontpage? Yes - there are discussions about it within specific, smaller subreddits, but careful attention is being given to ensure these threads remain confined within those subreddits, almost quarantined and restricted from reaching the front page where it would be seen by millions of people. We believe pro-Israel Zionist groups are carefully monitoring content on Reddit to ensure nothing ever reaches the front page - and thus shielding the majority of Reddit's users from the horrendous truth of what is taking place right now in Gaza. This website aims to document and report on this censorship.</p>  <p> Do you have examples of Reddit censoring content about the Genocide in Gaza?  <br>   <br>If you have experienced Reddit content suppression when trying to raise the flag about Israel's ongoing genocide of innocent Palestinians - then please submit your experience through  the form here . We're trying to document these examples of Reddit's suppression of the genocide, to retain a historic effort of how sites like Reddit, and BigTech in general, have helped to cover this up to protect the narrative surrounding Israel.</p>
